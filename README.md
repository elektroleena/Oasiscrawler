# Oasiscrawler
This is a project I worked on as part of my studies at FH Technikum Wien.
Oasiscrawler is a console-based game. The player's goal is to collect all relics on the field, fighting off hidden dangers with potions and avoiding the monster.
A specific introduction can be found at the beginning of the game.
